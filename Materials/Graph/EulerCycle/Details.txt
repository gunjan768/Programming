								FOR UNDIRECTED PATH	
Eulerian Path is a path in graph that visits every edge exactly once. Eulerian Circuit is an Eulerian Path which starts and ends on the same vertex.

Eulerian Cycle

An undirected graph has Eulerian cycle if following two conditions are true.
a) All vertices with non-zero degree are connected. We don’t care about vertices with zero degree because they don’t belong to Eulerian Cycle or Path (we only consider all edges).
b) All vertices have even degree.

Eulerian Path

An undirected graph has Eulerian Path if following two conditions are true.
a) Same as condition (a) for Eulerian Cycle
b) If zero or two vertices have odd degree and all other vertices have even degree. Note that only one vertex with odd degree is not possible in an undirected graph (sum of all degrees 
is always even in an undirected graph)

	
								FOR DIRECTED PATH

Eulerian Path is a path in graph that visits every edge exactly once. Eulerian Circuit is an Eulerian Path which starts and ends on the same vertex.

A graph is said to be eulerian if it has a eulerian cycle. We have discussed eulerian circuit for an undirected graph.

How to check if a directed graph is eulerian?
A directed graph has an eulerian cycle if following conditions are true (Source: Wiki)
1) All vertices belong to a single strongly connected component.
2) In degree is equal to the out degree for every vertex.
